-There is a lot of unused code that bloats the codebase making it less
accessible.
-The main file does not give an reasonable overview over how the code works.
Furthermore the top level functions are extremly large and not very descriptive.
-The overall architecture of the code is not very apperent.
-The masterbackup module appears to handle everything related to the master, in a
file called master.go, however there is also a module called nodes which
includes another file called master.go which also appears to handle the master.
-The tracability of the modules are not easy to follow.
-The code for the elevators statemachine is ok, we can see the underlying
structure, however it should be tidied up.
-The comments in the code are usefull, however there could be more.

-Way to long functions. The syncer, and fsm modules that contains the logic of
the program is only one function each. They should both be divided into smaller
function to get better reababillity.
-Way to much nested code.
-There is a lot of bad variable names, and unnesesary abreviations that makes
-The syncer has so bad variable names, and nested code that we gave up trying to
understand how it works. 
the code quite hard to read.
-The code for the HRA is missing, it looks like there is supposed to be a
module, hall_request_assigner that are not present. Functionalty from this
modules is used quite a few times. 
-It looks like it is just dumped much code into a module called system_types.
Most of the code in that module does not belong under such a module, and it only
makes the code hard to read, when code from that module is used. It should 
be seperatet into its own module.
-The underlying functionality of the code is apperent, but hard to find. However
we belive that this is possible to fix with enough time and effort.
